# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Board of Elections employee has tasked me with auditing the recent election results for a local election.  

The task included identifying the following
1. The total number of votes casts.
2. The total votes casts by county and the percentage of votes from each county.
3. Identify which county had the most voters
5. A list of all candidates that received votes.
6. The total number of votes each candidate received
7. the percentage of votes each candidate received
8. The winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## Research
Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
Which county had the largest number of votes?
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
## Summary
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
